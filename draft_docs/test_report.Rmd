## **Background**

Liberia’s development trajectory was profoundly shaped by its 14-year civil conflict (1989–2003), which devastated the nation’s economy, infrastructure, and human capital. Before the war, Liberia had made modest progress in sectors such as agriculture, mining, and education; however, by the end of the conflict, the country’s socioeconomic foundations had almost entirely collapsed. The long civil conflict resulted in the deaths of an estimated 150,000 to 250,000 people and displaced over half of the population, both internally and across borders [(Center for Justice and Accountability)](https://cja.org/where-we-work/liberia/). The nation’s economy experienced a near-total collapse during the civil conflict, with GDP per capita declining by more than 80 percent between 1980 and the early 2000s, making Liberia one of the world’s poorest countries [(World Bank, 2023)](https://data.worldbank.org/country/liberia).

The conflict’s impact on infrastructure and public services was equally catastrophic. The World Bank reported that Liberia’s national power grid and water systems were completely destroyed during the war years, leaving most communities without electricity, clean water, or sanitation [(World Bank, 2004)](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/765241468010485183/liberias-infrastructure-a-continental-perspective). Basic social services nearly vanished, and the health system disintegrated, with hospitals and clinics looted or burned. The education system suffered similar setbacks: thousands of schools were destroyed or abandoned, teachers fled the country, and an entire generation of children lost access to formal education [(United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 2006)](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/liberia2006en.pdf).

Liberia’s labour market was severely weakened during and after the civil conflict, leaving much of the population dependent on precarious and low-productivity work. Even prior to the Ebola crisis, formal employment opportunities were extremely limited, and the overwhelming majority of workers relied on informal activities marked by low wages, unstable income, and high vulnerability [(Flomo et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jid.3736). Moreover, high rates of illiteracy, poverty, and poor health outcomes severely limiting citizens’ ability to rebuild their lives. Rebuilding infrastructure, restoring basic services, and re-establishing social stability became national imperatives. These conditions underscored the urgency for post-conflict development interventions. As the UNDP emphasized, the reconstruction effort required a holistic approach that addressed not only physical damage but also institutional and governance weaknesses that had contributed to fragility [(UNDP, 2006)](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/liberia2006en.pdf). Furthermore, persistent inequalities between urban and rural counties, as well as between coastal and hinterland regions, made spatially targeted development strategies essential.

## **Post-War Development Plans**

In response to these challenges, post-war governments launched a series of national development plans aimed at rebuilding the economy and improving the well-being of its people. Each of these plans was supported by substantial inflows of development assistance from multilateral and bilateral partners. 

The first major national response to this challenge was the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS, 2008-2011), which sought to transition Liberia from emergency recovery to sustainable development. The PRS articulated a vision of “rapid, inclusive, and sustainable growth” structured around four key pillars: peace and security, economic revitalization, governance and rule of law, and infrastructure and basic services [(International Monetary Fund (IMF), 2008)](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2008/cr08219.pdf). The plan’s overarching goal was to reduce poverty through the reconstruction of critical infrastructure, including roads, electricity, and water systems, while simultaneously restoring health and education services. The PRS also aimed to re-establish government credibility and strengthen public financial management after years of institutional breakdown. By the end of its implementation period, Liberia had recorded modest economic growth and some improvements in service delivery, although challenges remained in employment creation and equitable service distribution [(IMF, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5089/9781463941055.002).

Building on the progress achieved under the PRS, the government launched the Agenda for Transformation (AfT, 2012-2017) as the second medium-term development framework. The AfT represented a deliberate shift from post-conflict recovery toward structural transformation and inclusive growth. Anchored in the long-term vision of Liberia Rising 2030, the AfT emphasized human capital development, private sector expansion, youth employment, and regional equity [(Republic of Liberia, 2013]( https://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/lbr169062.pdf); [UNDP, 2013](https://www.undp.org/liberia/publications/liberia-agenda-transformation)). It focused heavily on infrastructure, particularly roads, energy, and information and communications technology, as drivers of competitiveness and decentralization. The plan also prioritized institutional reforms aimed at strengthening transparency, governance, and the business environment. Expected outcomes included improved economic diversification, reduced regional disparities, and stronger human development indicators. Although implementation of the Agenda for Transformation (AfT) was disrupted by the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic, the plan nonetheless consolidated many of the recovery gains achieved during the post-conflict period and continued to guide reform efforts in subsequent years [(World Bank, 2017)](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/585371528125859387/pdf/Liberia-From-growth-to-development-priorities-for-sustainably-reducing-poverty-and-achieving-middle-income-status-by-2030.pdf).
 
The Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD, 2018-2023), which succeeded the AfT, was designed to address persistent inequality and to ensure that economic growth translated into improved living conditions for all Liberians. The PAPD adopted a rights-based, equity-driven approach with four interlinked pillars: Power to the People (human development and empowerment), Economy and Jobs (inclusive economic growth and job creation), Infrastructure and Resilience (sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructure), and Governance and Transparency (accountable and inclusive institutions) [(Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP), 2018)](https://climate-laws.org/document/pro-poor-agenda-for-prosperity-and-development_85c1). Its expected outcomes included reducing absolute poverty to below 20 percent, increasing income for at least one million Liberians, expanding access to education and healthcare, and strengthening decentralization to ensure that every county benefits from development resources [(MFDP, 2018)](https://climate-laws.org/document/pro-poor-agenda-for-prosperity-and-development_85c1). Collectively, the PRS, AfT, and PAPD trace Liberia’s gradual evolution from reconstruction to transformation to inclusion, reflecting an expanding focus from rebuilding state capacity to empowering citizens and promoting equitable growth across the nation’s fifteen counties. 
 
## **Liberia Post-War Development Challenges**

Despite successive national development plans and significant inflows of international assistance, Liberia continues to face deep and persistent development challenges that raise critical questions about the effectiveness of its post-war development strategies. Collectively, these plans have attracted billions of dollars in donor funding and technical assistance, yet many indicators of community well-being and human development remain below regional averages [(MFDP, 2018](https://climate-laws.org/document/pro-poor-agenda-for-prosperity-and-development_85c1); [United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 2023)](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/LBR). The persistence of poor living conditions, limited access to quality services, and high unemployment suggests that development outcomes have been unevenly distributed across the country’s fifteen counties.

Recent data underscore these disparities. According to the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services [(LISGIS, 2023)](https://lisgis.gov.lr/), over half of the population continues to live below the national poverty line, with substantial geographic variations between urban and rural areas. Access to electricity remains below 30 percent nationwide, and only a minority of households have improved sanitation or potable water sources [(World Bank, 2023)](https://data.worldbank.org/country/liberia). Educational attainment also lags, with inequality in education rates hovering around 42 percent, and healthcare access remains limited, particularly in rural counties [(UNDP, 2023)](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/LBR). Meanwhile, youth unemployment and underemployment remain acute, posing risks to social stability and economic productivity [(African Development Bank (AfDB), 2022)](https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/west-africa/liberia). These conditions reveal an implementation gap between national development planning and tangible improvements in citizens’ quality of life.

## **Measuring Liberia Development Outcomes**

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate Liberia's post-war development performance by integrating national human development analysis with a spatially disaggregated assessment of community well-being. Although Liberia has implemented three national development plans since 2008, the long-term effects of these plans on the quality of life of its citizens have not been adequately assessed. Government and donor reporting often emphasizes program outputs, such as infrastructure construction or service expansion, but provides limited systematic evaluations of how these investments translate into actual improvements in people's lives, especially at the county and regional levels.

To address this gap, the study employs two complementary frameworks:

**1.** **The Human Development Index (HDI)** captures national-level progress in education, health, and income.

**2.** **The Community Well-Being Index (CWI)**, developed from census-based indicators, measures living standards, infrastructure access, and material well-being across Liberia's fifteen counties and four regions.

Using both the HDI and the CWI allows the study to distinguish national progress from subnational disparities, revealing pockets of persistent vulnerability that national averages may obscure. The CWI, in particular, provides a multidimensional view of county-level conditions by integrating indicators related to housing, health vulnerabilities, water and sanitation, educational attainment, and geographic disadvantage. This dual-assessment approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of Liberia's development performance, identifying where gains have been broad-based and where structural inequalities remain entrenched.

Ultimately, this combined HDI-CWI framework enhances the evidence base for evaluating the country's development plans. It reveals not only whether Liberia has made overall progress but also whether that progress has been equitable and inclusive across counties and regions. These findings will help inform the design of Liberia's next medium-term development strategy and guide future investments toward areas of greatest need.

## **Research Design and Methodology**

This research utilized a mixed-method analytical design that combines both longitudinal and cross-sectional components to assess post-war development outcomes in Liberia. The first component involved a longitudinal analysis of the HDI in Liberia from 2008 to 2023, using annual national estimates published by the UNDP [(UNDP, 2024)]( https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI). This approach enabled the examination of long-term trends in human development across the three national development plan periods. 

The second component included a cross-sectional spatial analysis based on the 2023 National Population and Housing Census. Utilizing this census data, a CWI was created to measure county-level variations in material living standards, housing quality, access to services, and other aspects of community welfare. Since the CWI data were only available for 2023, this component offers a snapshot of current conditions rather than a comparison before and after an intervention. Therefore, this study is best described as a hybrid longitudinal–cross-sectional design instead of a quasi-experimental pre-post analysis.

To enhance statistical rigor, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be employed to assign objective, data-driven weights to each variable within the CWI. PCA reduces redundancy among correlated indicators and ensures that the final composite score accurately reflects the underlying variance in the data [(Jolliffe, I. T., & Cadima, J. 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2015.0202). By relying on an empirical weighting method rather than subjective judgments, this study provides a robust and transparent framework for capturing the multidimensional nature of community well-being. Through this methodology, the analysis establishes a solid empirical foundation for evaluating the effectiveness of Liberia’s national development plans in transforming county-level living conditions between 2008 and 2023.
