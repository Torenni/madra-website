## Background

Liberia’s development trajectory was profoundly shaped by its 14-year
civil conflict (1989–2003), which devastated the nation’s economy,
infrastructure, and human capital. Before the war, Liberia had made
modest progress in sectors such as agriculture, mining, and education;
however, by the end of the conflict, the country’s socioeconomic
foundations had almost entirely collapsed. The long civil conflict
resulted in the deaths of an estimated 150,000 to 250,000 people and
displaced over half of the population, both internally and across
borders [(Center for Justice and
Accountability)](https://cja.org/where-we-work/liberia/). The nation’s
economy experienced a near-total collapse during the civil conflict,
with GDP per capita declining by more than 80 percent between 1980 and
the early 2000s, making Liberia one of the world’s poorest countries
[(World Bank, 2023)](https://data.worldbank.org/country/liberia).

The conflict’s impact on infrastructure and public services was equally
catastrophic. The World Bank reported that Liberia’s national power grid
and water systems were completely destroyed during the war years,
leaving most communities without electricity, clean water, or sanitation
[(World Bank,
2004)](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/765241468010485183/liberias-infrastructure-a-continental-perspective).
Basic social services nearly vanished, and the health system
disintegrated, with hospitals and clinics looted or burned. The
education system suffered similar setbacks: thousands of schools were
destroyed or abandoned, teachers fled the country, and an entire
generation of children lost access to formal education [(United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP),
2006)](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/liberia2006en.pdf).

Liberia’s labour market was severely weakened during and after the civil
conflict, leaving much of the population dependent on precarious and
low-productivity work. Even prior to the Ebola crisis, formal employment
opportunities were extremely limited, and the overwhelming majority of
workers relied on informal activities marked by low wages, unstable
income, and high vulnerability [(Flomo et al.,
2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jid.3736). Moreover, high rates of
illiteracy, poverty, and poor health outcomes severely limiting
citizens’ ability to rebuild their lives. Rebuilding infrastructure,
restoring basic services, and re-establishing social stability became
national imperatives. These conditions underscored the urgency for
post-conflict development interventions. As the UNDP emphasized, the
reconstruction effort required a holistic approach that addressed not
only physical damage but also institutional and governance weaknesses
that had contributed to fragility [(UNDP,
2006)](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/liberia2006en.pdf).
Furthermore, persistent inequalities between urban and rural counties,
as well as between coastal and hinterland regions, made spatially
targeted development strategies essential.
