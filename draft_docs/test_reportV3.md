# Post-War Development Plans

In response to these challenges, post-war governments launched a series
of national development plans aimed at rebuilding the economy and
improving the well-being of its people. Each of these plans was
supported by substantial inflows of development assistance from
multilateral and bilateral partners.

The first major national response to this challenge was the Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS, 2008-2011), which sought to transition Liberia
from emergency recovery to sustainable development. The PRS articulated
a vision of “rapid, inclusive, and sustainable growth” structured around
four key pillars: peace and security, economic revitalization,
governance and rule of law, and infrastructure and basic services
[(International Monetary Fund (IMF),
2008)](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2008/cr08219.pdf). The
plan’s overarching goal was to reduce poverty through the reconstruction
of critical infrastructure, including roads, electricity, and water
systems, while simultaneously restoring health and education services.
The PRS also aimed to re-establish government credibility and strengthen
public financial management after years of institutional breakdown. By
the end of its implementation period, Liberia had recorded modest
economic growth and some improvements in service delivery, although
challenges remained in employment creation and equitable service
distribution [(IMF, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5089/9781463941055.002).

Building on the progress achieved under the PRS, the government launched
the Agenda for Transformation (AfT, 2012-2017) as the second medium-term
development framework. The AfT represented a deliberate shift from
post-conflict recovery toward structural transformation and inclusive
growth. Anchored in the long-term vision of Liberia Rising 2030, the AfT
emphasized human capital development, private sector expansion, youth
employment, and regional equity [(Republic of Liberia,
2013](https://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/lbr169062.pdf); [UNDP,
2013](https://www.undp.org/liberia/publications/liberia-agenda-transformation)).
It focused heavily on infrastructure, particularly roads, energy, and
information and communications technology, as drivers of competitiveness
and decentralization. The plan also prioritized institutional reforms
aimed at strengthening transparency, governance, and the business
environment. Expected outcomes included improved economic
diversification, reduced regional disparities, and stronger human
development indicators. Although implementation of the Agenda for
Transformation (AfT) was disrupted by the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic, the
plan nonetheless consolidated many of the recovery gains achieved during
the post-conflict period and continued to guide reform efforts in
subsequent years [(World Bank,
2017)](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/585371528125859387/pdf/Liberia-From-growth-to-development-priorities-for-sustainably-reducing-poverty-and-achieving-middle-income-status-by-2030.pdf).

The Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD, 2018-2023),
which succeeded the AfT, was designed to address persistent inequality
and to ensure that economic growth translated into improved living
conditions for all Liberians. The PAPD adopted a rights-based,
equity-driven approach with four interlinked pillars: Power to the
People (human development and empowerment), Economy and Jobs (inclusive
economic growth and job creation), Infrastructure and Resilience
(sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructure), and Governance and
Transparency (accountable and inclusive institutions) [(Ministry of
Finance and Development Planning (MFDP),
2018)](https://climate-laws.org/document/pro-poor-agenda-for-prosperity-and-development_85c1).
Its expected outcomes included reducing absolute poverty to below 20
percent, increasing income for at least one million Liberians, expanding
access to education and healthcare, and strengthening decentralization
to ensure that every county benefits from development resources [(MFDP,
2018)](https://climate-laws.org/document/pro-poor-agenda-for-prosperity-and-development_85c1).
Collectively, the PRS, AfT, and PAPD trace Liberia’s gradual evolution
from reconstruction to transformation to inclusion, reflecting an
expanding focus from rebuilding state capacity to empowering citizens
and promoting equitable growth across the nation’s fifteen counties.
