# Measuring Liberia Development Outcomes

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate Liberia’s post-war
development performance by integrating national human development
analysis with a spatially disaggregated assessment of community
well-being. Although Liberia has implemented three national development
plans since 2008, the long-term effects of these plans on the quality of
life of its citizens have not been adequately assessed. Government and
donor reporting often emphasizes program outputs, such as infrastructure
construction or service expansion, but provides limited systematic
evaluations of how these investments translate into actual improvements
in people’s lives, especially at the county and regional levels.

To address this gap, the study employs two complementary frameworks:

**1.** **The Human Development Index (HDI)** captures national-level
progress in education, health, and income.

**2.** **The Community Well-Being Index (CWI)**, developed from
census-based indicators, measures living standards, infrastructure
access, and material well-being across Liberia’s fifteen counties and
four regions.

Using both the HDI and the CWI allows the study to distinguish national
progress from subnational disparities, revealing pockets of persistent
vulnerability that national averages may obscure. The CWI, in
particular, provides a multidimensional view of county-level conditions
by integrating indicators related to housing, health vulnerabilities,
water and sanitation, educational attainment, and geographic
disadvantage. This dual-assessment approach enables a more comprehensive
understanding of Liberia’s development performance, identifying where
gains have been broad-based and where structural inequalities remain
entrenched.

Ultimately, this combined HDI-CWI framework enhances the evidence base
for evaluating the country’s development plans. It reveals not only
whether Liberia has made overall progress but also whether that progress
has been equitable and inclusive across counties and regions. These
findings will help inform the design of Liberia’s next medium-term
development strategy and guide future investments toward areas of
greatest need.
